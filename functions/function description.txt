Functions in Python are first-class objects, which means that you can
pass them around as youâ€™d do with any other object. You can also use
them as arguments and return values of other functions.
Functions that accept other functions as arguments or that return
functions (or both) are known as higher-order functions, which are also
a desirable feature in functional programming.
